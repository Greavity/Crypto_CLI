Hi,

Unfortunately I couldn't make whole task. Script is only calculating average price for given period.

I want to create separate apps for handle API, CLI and database but I run out of time and didn't manage to refactor it.

Anyway I will be happy to receive any feedback.

To run script you need to type:

cli.py --start_date DD-MM-YYYY --end_date DD-MM-YYYY

Thank you and sorry for this horrible code.
